# Railway-Ticketing-Microservice-API
Developed a Spring Boot REST API for railway ticket management with CRUD operations, PNR-based search, premium ticket upgrades, and custom exception handling.
Designed the service to communicate with a separate Meal microservice using PNR. API testing performed using Postman.
